Olly BP Manager - Breakpoint List Sets
Copyright (C) 2005 Pedram Amini

One of the benefits of Olly BP Manager is the ability to save and
exchange generally useful breakpoint "sets". The samples included in
this directory are specific to Windows XP SP2:

    msvcrt.dll - Example BP set for use when auditing for string
                 manipulation vulnerabilities.
    ntdll.dll  - Example BP set for use with vulnerability development
                 involving heap overflows.
    ws2_32.dll - Example BP set for tracing user data received from a
                 socket.
                 
The above breakpoint sets are module centric and included only as
examples. I envision generalized sets to develop and mature that will
include breakpoints across modules. I encourage users to submit useful
breakpoint sets to me for credit and inclusion in future releases and on
the release web site.
